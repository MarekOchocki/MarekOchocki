# About me
Hi, Iâ€™m @MarekOchocki

For my private projects I use mainly C++ and SFML and recently I'm experimenting with GLSL shaders and interesting visual effects.
I'm heavily clean-architecture and clean-code focused. I try to build my projects in such a way that I can easily reuse created code in multiple projects.
It mailny comes down to splitting code into libraries (or modules outside c++). 

Professionally I'm working as an Angular Web Developer. I'm familiar with Typescript, Node.js and NgRx.

## Metaballs
C++ and SFML

I've created a Metaballs project inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oMZb3yP_H8&t=1451s&ab_channel=Reducible).

## Particles + Blur
C++ and SFML

I developed a lib that allows to create separate layers that independently of each other render image and handle events (or intercepts them).

In this example we can see 6 layers:
- 5 layers with particles of different color and mass
- 1 blur layer that applies gaussian blur on rendered 5 particle layers

## Ants
repository: [Ants Repository](https://github.com/MarekOchocki/AntsProject)

This is a bigger project that includes implementation of artificial neural network, gradient descent and reinforcement learning.
These are combined with SFML to create artificial environment where "ants" are trying to learn to efficiently gather resources from chessboard-like board.

At first they make random moves

But after a moment the ants become pretty efficient in their task
